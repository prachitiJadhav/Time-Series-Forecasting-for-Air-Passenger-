# Time-Series-Forecasting-for-Air-Passenger
Air Passengers data forecasting using Time Series Analytics. It involves analyzing historical data on the number of air passengers and forecasting future passenger traffic based on data patterns and trends. 
The project's main goal is to create a predictive model that accurately predicts the number of air passengers for the next 12 months, allowing airlines to plan and optimize their operations accordingly. 
The key steps involved in the project include optimal forecasting technique, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and model evaluation. Various time series forecasting techniques such as ARIMA, MA, and Multiple Regression are used to build predictive models, and each model's accuracy is assessed using various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). 
The project concludes with a discussion of the findings and their implications for the airline industry.
